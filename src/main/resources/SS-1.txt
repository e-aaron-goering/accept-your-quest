	For decades the automotive industry promised us all cars that could run 
more effeciently, drive themselves, and eventually even fly.  For decades those 
promises kept getting pushed further and further out into the future, while we, 
and including yourself, most likely, pined for those amazing promises.  Even 
today, as cars are beginning to touch upon those technologies, they remain 
something only the most wealthy can afford and even if you could afford it, they 
still leave something to be desired.

	The tv and movies of yesteryear havne't helped this desire.  Showing us 
vehicles capable of incredible stunts and gadgetry.  Whether you're a fan of 
Knight Rider or James Bond, Batman or Back to the Future, the notion of possessing
a truly astounding vehicle appeals to you.  Too bad they only exist in the realm 
of fantasy.  Or do they? 
	
	Today seemed like any other day so far.  You woke up, washed, got dressed,
and went to the same tedious job you do every day.  Making your way through the 
stop-and-go traffic.  Your job gave you the usual frustrations as you toiled 
through the daily grind.  After work, made your way slowly through the return 
traffic.  Before reaching your home, you realized that you were low on a few 
supplies for the week, so you decided to make a quick run to the grocery store.

	As you drive, you notice the stop light ahead turn yellow, just long 
enough to turn red before you make it through.  It happens to be the light before 
at the intersection to the parking lot of the store.  You wait patiently for the 
light to turn green.  You notice a #cc# #cm# drive through into the parking lot 
and you smile at it wistfully wishing you could own one.  The light has turned 
green for you, and the driver behind you honks at you to drive through.  You say a
few choice expletives about his mother and proceed to make the turn into the 
parking lot.  That's when your world is turned upside down.  Literally.
