	There was a loud bang as your car was hit by another, going at such a 
speed that it flipped yours completely over.  You look out through your shattered 
windshield to see what looks like the love child of a UFO and a Lamborghini sit 
still looking like it doesn't have a single scratch or dent on it.  Police sirens 
approach in the distance.  The car's wheels spin rapidly, throwing smoke as it 
speeds out of sight.

	Sharp pain in your left leg seems to come from no where as your adrenaline
wears off.  Before you fade into blackness you think of a few more choice 
expletives for the rich indivdual who owned the car that just ruined your day.
