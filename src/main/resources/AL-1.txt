	An unidentifiable human silhouette cloaked in a cliche beige trenchcoat walked swiftly down the dark alleyway. The overcast sky reflecting the city lights
making it seem as if it was twilight, though it was closer to 3AM.  The newspaper
that the wind blew along in front of the figure as it walked indicated he or she 
was striding through an alleyway sometime in the 1980's in downtown Chicago. 

	At the end of the alleyway, where it was darkest, a man's voice spoke up.

	"Did you bring it?" he asked, menacingly.

	"You know I did," the voice revealing the fact that it was a woman dressed
in the unflattering coat.

	"Let's see it," the man replied.

	"This is supposed to be a trade."

	"Not anymore, it's not" the man stated as a flash of light and loud bang
indicated he had fired a pistol at the woman.  She dropped to the ground with a 
scream, a black leather breifcase sliding along the ground.  Her blood pooling 
underneath her as her life faded away.

	The murderer bent down and picked up the breifcase, walking out of the 
alleyway and down the street just as the first police sirens began to be heard off
in the distance.
