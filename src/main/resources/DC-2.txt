	You back away from the twisting oval, shivering with fear.  You step on a 
DVD that had been tossed around in the chaos earlier.  It shatters and cuts your 
left heel.  You grimace but continue backing up, now limping.  You trip on a shoe 
and fall down sprawled out on your bed.  You clutch at the comforter and cover 
your head, cowering in the farthest corner of the bed from the door.  You shake 
for what seems like an eternity until the telltale hum from the portal dies down.
It was really only a couple of minutes.  Clearly you are not one for adventure. 
You slowly peek out from under the covers and verify that it has vanished. 

	Over the next few days you feel as if you've been able to dismiss the 
whole event as if it had been a bad nightmare.  You're life returns to normal, you
continue to go to work or school or whatever it is you do on an average day.

	Everything is back to normal, of course, except for your sanity and the 
pain you get in your heel during thunderstorms that reminds you of that episode on
that fateful day.  As the years go by, nightmares about that day resurface, and 
every electric hum you hear startles you and nearly sends you into a paranoid 
panic.  That's only natural for someone who shies away from a little old 
interdimensional portal.
  
	*THE END.*
