	You look around the corner to see a balding, rotund man in a grey business
suit running towards you, looking sweaty and panicked.  He pushes you back into 
the aisle as a few loud bangs erupt and the breakfast cereal boxes explode near 
your heads.  Apparently somone is firing at you.

	You would have screamed except that when the gentleman pushed you back 
into the aisle he also caused you both to trip and his girth knocked the air out 
of your lungs.  You also felt a sharp stab of pain in your thigh.

	"Oh dear God, I'm so sorry!  It wasn't meant to be for you!" the man 
shouts out his apology.  

	Suddenly you feel woozy and begine to see colors swirling before your 
eyes.  You see patterns of #fc# and #sc# swirling, becoming plaid, until the 
silhouette of a person in primarily #fc# begins to form.  You hear more shots 
firing and shouting, but it seems distant and far away.  Then you black out 
entirely.
